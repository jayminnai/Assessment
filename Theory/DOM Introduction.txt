Introduction ( Document Object Model )


		DOM is a way to represent the webpage in a sturctured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmer and users
to guide through the document. with DOM we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, Classes, Attribute or element of HTML using commands
or method provided by the document object.

		Using DOM, the javascript gets access to HTML as well as CSS of the web page and can also add behavior to the HTML element.
